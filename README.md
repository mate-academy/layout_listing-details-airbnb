# Listing details for Airbnb

## Main goal:
Create HTML page with listing details.

Use this [mockup](https://www.figma.com/file/MUTaFua1Aaf2kAmfwLUPnswr/AirBnB%3A-Listing-details?node-id=0%3A1)
for development.

If you don't want to see other users cursors you can disable `Multiplayer
Cursors` in figma. [Learn how](https://mate-academy.github.io/layout_task-guideline/figma.html#multiplayer-cursors)

## Common mistakes
* Do not use tabs. Use 2 spaces for indentation.
* Don't use repeated styles.
* Check font styles. Use [fonts](https://github.com/potyt/fonts/tree/master/macfonts/Avenir)
* Image should be responsive.

## Requirements:
* use images from [src/images](src/images)
* image must have width 100%
* follow styles from the mock
* don't use JavaScript
* `css:reference & css:test` are not necessary
* use `@font-face` for fonts
